Hello! This is my badge browser for Kongregate! Take a seat! You can use the app itself at http://badge.wolfthatissavage.com/

~== Installation ==~
If you want to use this on your own server for some reason, follow these instructions. (You need PHP on your server)

1.	Get the source. Duh.
2.	Place the source where you want the app to exist, for example, I used a folder and mapped it to the subdomain badge.wolfthatissavage.com/
3.	Rename conf.js and conf.php from their names, it should be obvious what to remove...
4.	Crack open conf.js and configure like mad!
5.	Set "php /path/to/rssUpdate.php on a crontab so it autoupdates. I set mine to every 15mins.
6.	It should work now.

If you want to use a ranking system, it is not so simple... And you need to make a mySQL database.

1.	Make a new table called badgebrowse_ranking (with a new database if needed)
2.	Set it up as thus:
	ID: int(11), AUTO_INCREMENT
	easy:int(4)
	medium:int(4)
	hard:int(4)
	impossible:int(4)
	allb:int(4)
	points:int(8)
	username:tinytext, utf8_unicode_ci
3.	Open up config.php and fill in all the info.
4.	Set RANKING as true in config.js.

~== Customisations ==~
So you want to customise it? OK!

To add a new badge set:
1.	Go to img, copy a folder there, and rename it.
2.	Draw the images using the existing filenames.
3.	Find where it says like <a onclick='setSet("circular")' title='Circular, by SavageWolf'><img src='img/circular/B_medium_medium.png' style='border:0px'/></a>, and add a new one.

To add more random hints:
1.	Open messages.json
2.	Edit messages.json
3.	Save messages.json

~== Boring Legal Stuff ==~

Generally, you can do whatever you want. Yay! :D It would be nice if you gave me credit, but you don't strictly HAVE to...
